# Getting Started with the Raven MVP

MVP means "Minimum Viable Product" - the simplest version of something that actually works. 

## Prerequisites

You will need your own GPT-3 access in order to use Raven. At present, GPT-3 is the only cognitive engine capable of running Raven. You can apply for access to GPT-3 here: [https://beta.openai.com/](https://beta.openai.com/)

In the future, this should be easier to sign up for. As it is still in beta, you will need to apply for access. 

## Steps

1. Get the [code](https://github.com/daveshap/Raven_MVP)
2. Install `requirements.txt`
3. Create `openaiapikey.txt` with your API key
4. Run `nexus.py` and go to http://localhost:9999/nexus
5. Start the other services on the **Microservices** tab
6. Submit a context in the **Context** tab
